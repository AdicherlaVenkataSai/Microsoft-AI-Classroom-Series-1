# Artificial Intelligence
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI can be defined as the theory and development of computer to be able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence such as :
  
  
- Visual perception 
- Speech Recognition
- Decision-Making
- Translation between languages etc.

### Business Understanding
  
- **Goals :**
  
  - Specify the key variables that are to serve as the model targets and whose related metrics are used determine the success of the project.
  - Identify the relevant data sources that the business has access to or needs to obtain.

- **There are two main tasks addressed in this stage :**
  - **Define objectives :** Work with your customer and other stakeholders to understand and identify the business problems. Formulate questions that define the business goals that the data science techniques can target.
  - **Identify data sources :** Find the relevant data that helps you answer the questions that define the objectives of the project.
  
### Data acquisition and understanding
  
- **Goals :**
  
  - Produce a clean, high-quality data set whose relationship to the target variables is understood. Locate the data set in the appropriate analytics environment so you are ready to model.
  - Develop a solution architecture of the data pipeline that refreshes and scores the data regularly.
  
- **There are three main tasks addressed in this stage :**
  - **Ingest the data** into the target analytic environment.
  - **Explore the data** to determine if the data quality is adequate to answer the question.
  - **Set up a data pipeline** to score new or regularly refreshed data.
  
### Modelling
  
- **Goals :**
  
  - Determine the optimal data features for the machine-learning model.
  - Create an informative machine-learning model that predicts the target most accurately.
  - Create a machine-learning model that's suitable for production.
  
- **There are three main tasks addressed in this stage :**
  
  - **Feature engineering :** Create data features from the raw data to facilitate model training.
  - **Model training :** Find the model that answers the question most accurately by comparing their success metrics.
  - Determine if your model is **suitable for production.**
  
### Deployment
  
- **Goal :**
  
  - Deploy models with a data pipeline to a production or production-like environment for final user acceptance.

- **The main task addressed in this stage :**
  
  - **Operationalize the model :** Deploy the model and pipeline to a production or production-like environment for application consumption.
  
### Customer acceptance
  
- **Goal :**
  
  - **Finalize project deliverables :** Confirm that the pipeline, the model, and their deployment in a production environment satisfy the customer's objectives.
  
- **There are two main tasks addressed in this stage :**
  
  - **System validation :** Confirm that the deployed model and pipeline meet the customer's needs.
  - **Project hand-off :** Hand the project off to the entity that's going to run the system in production.
